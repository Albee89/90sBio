Welcome to my 90s-inspired, Clueless-themed Nostalgic Portfolio and Bio. As a baby coder, I thought that this fun inspiration from 1995 "Clueless" Cher's Wardrobe by Juliana Praxedes, which I used as inspiration for the starting iterations of my MoreDrobe App and decided to use as a cute portfolio and links to external social media and portfoilio, with a taste of some of the projects I have worked on thus far.
